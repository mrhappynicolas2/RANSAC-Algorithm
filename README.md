# RANSAC Algorithm
 Algorithm which can find a pattern in a cluster of points, and group them together

# How to use it
This algorythm works by reading a XYZ file with a large ammount of points, it will then find a pattern and save it to a different XYZ file
XYZ files can be read with free online visualiers such as https://imagetostl.com/view-xyz-online
